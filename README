* RUWIDO V-USB-HID Receiver by Alexander Meyer *
*                                              *
************************************************

This Code is a blend of V-USB and the Ruwido decoder by Guenter Bartsch.
It runs on the ATMega8 as well as the 48-328 family. You also need a
56kHz IR-receiver, e.g. the TSOP1756.

See http://vusb.wikidot.com/hardware for general information on the
USB-interface.

This Package is configured for the USBASP,solder the TSOP output to PIND3 of the controller.

 * to interrupt pin INT0!

TODO:

Aggregation of modifyers does not work correctly yet.
Not all Keycodes are mapped since I didn't find codes for some of the Keys
in the USB-HID spec.
